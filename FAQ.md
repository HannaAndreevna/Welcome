# What is the openMAVN project?

MAVN is an abbreviation of the word “MAVEN”, which came from Yiddish and means  “one, who understands”.

OpenMAVN is an open-source platform, which is being developed by MAVN Alliance. The aim of this project is to use technologies to connect small and medium businesses with government, organizations, and people. In order to support that idea we have created a «Smart Voucher» concept, which is an automated, transparent and rapid tool to support each participant of the platform. Basically, a business will be able to issue a voucher that its customers can buy and redeem at a later date for goods and/or services, or exchange. 

It is a genuine effort and has no commercial interest. We believe there is a better and more cost-effective way of supporting the economy and creating a better sense of solidarity.

Feel free to share MAVN Alliance initiative and OpenMAVN project with anyone who may be interested to participate. Only together we can provide a useful, cost-effective, and secure solution to all struggling parties:
