# General
## What is this alliance is about?

We aim to create an ecosystem based on distributed networks to tackle the problems of shock on demand and supply in the times of crisis such as COVID-19

## Why is this project useful?

In time of crisis, we need to be able to react quickly and make sure that help is delivered as fast as possible and in a transparent way, and that supply chain does not get broken. We would like to create a semi-autonomous governance system to fill this gap for the people by the people for liberty, equality and fratenity of humankind.
